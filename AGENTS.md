- Cloud games default to the standalone /play view to avoid mounting the app shell during gameplay; keep inline playback as an explicit fallback.
- Use only verified provider-native graphics controls; FivePlay profiles live in the shared game-performance module so other providers never receive invented engine flags.
- Gameplay's lightweight styling is temporary and must not overwrite the user's saved appearance preferences.
- Console skins reuse isolated console routes, catalog/player and stable installed IDs; appearances stay in prefs, separate from desktop layouts.
- Reference console screens share one skin-scoped presentation for PS5, Xbox, Wii and Neutral, composing real catalog/library actions without fabricated system telemetry.

- Browser proxy transports must live inside `createClientOnlyFn` so Worker module initialization never evaluates browser WASM transport packages.
- Opening choices and explicit account confirmation are document-scoped through VisitProvider; persisted preferences or restored auth sessions never mark a new visit complete, and standalone gameplay bypasses this flow.
- Layout selection precedes the shared account picker on each document; account-specific device/focus setup is saved in profiles so returning users are not asked again.
- Username accounts use normalized internal Auth email identities and optional contact email, with server-only identity resolution and rate-limited password verification; usernames never grant roles.
- Guest mode is a session-tab flag in AuthProvider that lets the signed-in layouts render with no Auth session; nothing saves because database policies only accept signed-in users, so never give guests an anonymous Auth user.
- Configure the generated Auth client for session-tab storage and close its cross-tab auth broadcast before router rendering; saved-account tokens live separately so account switching and sign-out stay local to each tab.
- The guest browser relay accepts same-origin public GET/HEAD reads only; signed-in authentication remains mandatory for proxy mutations and account data.
- Developer sign-in is hidden: no visible entry; the account screen opens a PIN pad via a keyboard shortcut or an invisible corner button, and the PIN is checked only on the server.
- Console media and arcade launches use router navigation to retain the current document's visit confirmation; cloud games alone open the standalone player tab.
- Console game artwork goes through one shared resolver: the game's source thumbnail first (arcade cover, cloud site screenshot), bundled genre illustration as fallback.
- In Console Mode, media/app routes render in ConsoleAppFrame instead of AppShell so console users never see the classic sidebar.
- Every embedded third-party page loads via openProxied; install popup interception before page scripts. OAuth reuses named native windows, retains the actual caller as opener, and routes delayed blank-window navigation at the top level; arcade bridge messages remain source-validated and return a delayed-navigation handle rather than null.
- Movie players load local app pages directly and proxy only external HTTP(S) sources; reject real-origin proxy launches to prevent recursive service-worker fetch failures.
- Shared authentication and arcade views live in components rather than exported route components, preventing route splitting from pulling browser-only dependencies into the server entry.
- Xbox Series X screens compose the shared catalog, library actions and authenticated console routes; skin-scoped styles and a reusable guide preserve Sony and regular layouts.

- Cloud games use the shared launch resolver: GTA V has its tuned relay; streaming services and hostname-sensitive account games use the complete-site proxy to retain virtual origins and online sockets; other games use the allowlisted same-domain relay, with isolation only for big AAA ports.
- The Xbox home shelves list only titles the user has installed; unowned games stay in the store.
- The cloud relay explicitly allowlists verified provider asset hosts and rewrites dynamic iframe/script URLs as well as static markup; portal-only relaying leaves games blocked on separate CDN hosts.
- Provider game-only entry overrides live in the shared cloud relay resolver, retaining original catalog URLs and installed IDs so launch repairs do not discard libraries.
- Retrora's frontend location defaults are repaired before Scramjet rewriting in the shared transport adapter; preserve its virtual origin for terrain, account redirects and online sockets without buffering engine or range downloads.
- Social features use a single authenticated hub across console shells and media frames; all social mutations go through an auth-scoped database function so party membership, blocks and ownership cannot be bypassed by clients.
- Layout appearance profiles live in the existing preferences store with shared settings and CSS tokens; switching shells restores that layout's profile without overwriting another layout or gameplay's temporary styling.
- Windows desktop uses a shared client-side window model and reusable app views, never nested authenticated shells; cloud games keep their standalone launch for isolation and proxy compatibility.
- Windows consolidates legacy desktop choices via prefs-load migration, preserving wallpapers; legacy profiles stay archived. DesktopSurface/AppIcon and StoreView reuse existing apps.
- App-specific navigation lives in shared views with skin-scoped native-app styling; wallpaper effects mount once per desktop/console shell and obey motion/performance preferences to preserve playback and gameplay isolation.
- Developer-added games use a shared authenticated catalog protected by server role checks and database policies; arbitrary cloud URLs use the existing full proxy fallback, while arcade URLs reuse the inline player with proxied navigation.
- Music shares a player and iTunes IDs; server-only GOOGLE_API_KEY overrides the YouTube connector for workspace moves. Piped keeps /api/music failover and playlists/widgets.
- Qaisify navigation and settings adapt into the shared MusicView and player, never mount a second router/player; theme selection stays in shared prefs and catalog searches isolate optional lookup failures so songs remain available.
- Movie voice search verifies tracks, retries once per source and respects manual playback; all animation can confirm MAL/AniList dub entries, while Anikoto opens its real search through the proxy, not a guessed embed API.
- Switch composes existing routes. Desktop widgets use bounded Rnd geometry in appearance profiles, shared music/Open-Meteo and per-user local notes; guest notes stay in memory.
- Wallpapers use owner-only backgrounds storage and per-layout prefs; guest images use temporary object URLs. Custom accents use shared CSS tokens.
- Imported wallpaper catalogs use the shared original-source URL map because old project-scoped CDN pointers can die; all shell backdrops use WallpaperMedia for silent visibility-aware playback and per-layout poster/type persistence.
- Wallpaper category inference and normalized title search live in the shared catalog helper; chooser previews are inert miniatures, never mounted shells, to keep opening lightweight.
- Wallpaper catalogs use uncompressed original downloads with probed native dimensions; a shared URL-upgrade map upgrades previously saved preview selections without changing custom uploads or layout preferences.
- Native wallpaper videos bypass image zoom/drift transforms and use normal browser video decoding with no frame cap; asset URL upgrades normalize absolute URLs and cache queries.
- Explicit wallpaper playback choices are per-layout overrides of motion/performance limits for that video only; hidden tabs still pause, and other effects retain accessibility settings.
- Music-bar visibility uses shared preferences and never changes player state, so hiding or restoring it works across shells without interrupting songs.
- Account preferences use owner-only user_preferences JSON storage and account-keyed device caches; identity switches load defaults or that owner's data, and guests remain memory-only.
- Windows title shortcuts store stable catalog identifiers in shared account preferences; arcade launches reuse GamesView, movie launches use router navigation, and cloud shortcuts retain standalone playback.
- First-account personalization edits a local draft and composes the same preview and controls as Settings; save the confirmed appearance before marking account setup complete.
- macOS and iPad layouts share one AppleDesktop shell (variant prop) with the Windows window model and the shared DesktopAppContent app views, so all desktop-style layouts open the same apps without nested shells.
- Store-downloadable mini apps use `tool:<id>` desktop app IDs from the shared tool catalog; installs are per-device and launchers merge them via useLauncherApps so every desktop layout lists them.
- Arcade game pages reroute Photon multiplayer sockets through the app's /api/game-ws relay (allowlisted hosts only) so networks blocking game ports can still connect.
- Device bans are keyed by a per-browser device ID and checked server-side via is_device_banned; the site owner is protected by a DB trigger and the ban check itself. Screen viewing uses a non-modal docked viewer and adaptive idle-time compressed screenshots with media layers and a DOM-outline fallback over a one-off channel named in an admin-only command, preserving fidelity and target responsiveness without requiring a new schema.
- Troll CSS targets only the viewport-sized #site-content wrapper, never html/body, so fixed desktop layouts keep their dimensions; every effect has a timed/explicit stop and Escape dismissal.
